I lead the Graph Engine team in [Katana Graph](https://katanagraph.com/),
the startup based in part on my PhD research.
The startup was founded in 2020 by
[Dr. Keshav Pingali](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/) and
[Dr. Chris Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/).
We are looking for motivated engineers. Please look at the
[careers](https://katanagraph.com/company/careers) page and
apply directly if you are interested.

I received my PhD from the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/),
where I was advised by [Dr. Keshav Pingali](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pingali/).
I received my masters from the
[Indian Institute of Science](http://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/), where I was advised by
[Dr. Uday Bondhugula](http://drona.csa.iisc.ernet.in/~uday/).

During the summer of 2018 and 2019, I was a research intern in
[Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-in-software-engineering-rise/),
where I collaborated with several researchers including
[Dr. Olli Saarikivi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/olsaarik/),
[Dr. Kim Laine](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kilai/), and
[Dr. Madan Musuvathi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/madanm/).

# Research Interests

My research interests are broadly in the field of
**programming languages and systems**,
with an emphasis on optimizing compilers and runtime systems for
*distributed* and *heterogeneous* architectures.
Currently, my focus is on building
large-scale graph databasesÂ and systems for machine learning. In recent work,
I have built programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems for
**distributed, heterogeneous graph processing** and
**privacy-preserving neural network inferencing**.
This work has been published in PLDI, ASPLOS, VLDB, IPDPS, PPoPP, PACT, and IISWC.
A brief summary of my past work can be found below.
<!-- My goal is to build domain-specific
**programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems**
that make it easy to develop efficient
**graph processing**
on large-scale *distributed* clusters,
while utilizing *heterogeneous* architectures.
<!-- Towards this goal,
I have built programming systems for
*distributed and heterogeneous graph analytics*
and
*privacy-preserving neural network inferencing*.
My vision is to enable
developers to express their application
in a domain-specific language
and run it efficiently on a variety of architectures
under different scenarios like sparsity or privacy of the datasets. -->
<!-- and
introduces new techniques in programming systems
for sparse computing and privacy-preserving applications respectively.  -->

<!-- Existing computers have complex parallel architectures including
heterogeneous processors like CPUs and GPUs, non-uniform memory, and
non-volatile memory.
It is tedious for application developers to get good performance
without utilizing the architectural features.
Existing programs come from diverse application domains and are written
by experts in those domains, rather than experts in parallel programming.
It is also difficult to get good performance unless
the domain expertise is exploited.
I aim to bridge the gap between application domain experts and
parallel architectures
by working on *programming models, compilers, and
runtimes that enable application developers to extract performance
from parallel architectures with little effort*.  -->

**Distributed and Heterogeneous Graph Processing**:
Unstructured datasets are used by applications in areas such as
machine learning,
data mining, bioinformatics, network science, and security.
These datasets may be represented as graphs and these graphs may have
billions of nodes and trillions of edges.
One way to process such large datasets is to use distributed clusters.
For graph analytical applications, I have designed and built
programming systems that exploit domain knowledge to partition graphs
and optimize communication,
while providing application-specific fault-tolerance.
Existing shared-memory graph analytics frameworks or applications
can use our system to scale out to distributed CPUs and GPUs.

<!-- I intend to build on this to support
*distributed and heterogeneous systems for sparse computation
like graph databases, graph mining, graph embeddings,
sparse deep learning, and mesh-based numerical simulation*. -->

**Single Machine Graph Processing**:
Graph pattern mining applications are used in chemical engineering,
bioinformatics, and social sciences. I have worked on building a
high-level programming language and runtime system that can execute
such applications on shared-memory CPUs or a GPU. For graph analytical
applications, I have worked on improving the performance of graph
analytics systems on byte-addressable memory like Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory.
I have also compared different language abstractions and
runtime systems for graph analytics on shared-memory CPUs, and
identified their performance bottlenecks.

**Privacy-Preserving Neural Network Inferencing**:
In many applications, privacy of the datasets used must be preserved.
Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data
without requiring the secret key.
However, cryptographic domain expertise is required to use FHE.
In my view, FHE libraries are akin to specialized parallel architectures.
I have developed an optimizing compiler for
translating tensor programs like neural network inferencing
to run on encrypted data using FHE libraries
efficiently, while guaranteeing security and accuracy
of the computation.

<!-- Building on this, I intend to help program *privacy-preserving
applications including large-scale data analytics and databases*. -->

<!-- **Threat Detection Using Graph Querying**: In this project supported by DARPA, property
graphs with attributes are built from event logs on machines. Advanced Persistent
Threats (APT) on these machines are detected by querying the property graphs for
specific patterns. I have designed a compiler for running these queries efficiently
so that APTs can be detected in real-time. -->

**Affine Loop Nests**:
Any sequence of arbitrarily nested loops with affine bounds and accesses
are known as regular or affine loop nests.
Examples include
stencil-style computations, linear algebra kernels,
and alternating direction implicit integrations.
During my masters, I developed compiler techniques using the polyhedral model
to automatically extract tasks from sequential affine loop nests and
dynamically schedule them to run on distributed CPUs and
GPUs with efficient data movement code.
I also helped generate distributed-memory code for loop nests
that contain both affine and irregular accesses.

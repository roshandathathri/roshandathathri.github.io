### Abstract

Graph pattern mining (GPM) is a key building block in
diverse applications, including bioinformatics, chemical engineering, social network analysis, recommender systems and
security. Existing GPM frameworks either provide high-level
interfaces for productivity at the cost of expressiveness or
provide expressive low-level interfaces at the cost of increased
programming complexity. They also lack the flexibility to
explore combinations of optimizations to achieve performance
competitive with hand-optimized applications.

We present Sandslash, an in-memory graph pattern mining
framework that uses a novel programming interface to support
productive, expressive, and efficient GPM on large graphs.
Sandslash provides a high-level API that only needs a specification of the GPM problem from the user, and the system
implements fast subgraph enumeration, provides efficient data
structures, and applies high-level optimizations automatically.
To achieve performance competitive with expert-optimized
implementations, Sandslash also provides a low-level API
that allows users to express algorithm-specific optimizations.
This enables Sandslash to support both high-productivity
and high-efficiency without losing expressiveness. We evaluate Sandslash using five GPM applications and a wide range
of real-world graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that
applications written using Sandslashâ€™s high-level or low-level
API outperform those in state-of-the-art GPM systems AutoMine, Pangolin, and Peregrine on average by 13.8x, 7.9x,
and 5.4x, respectively. We also show that these Sandslash
applications outperform expert-optimized GPM implementations by 2.3x on average with less programming effort.
